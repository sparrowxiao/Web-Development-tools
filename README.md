### Browser Inspector
- I always use Google Chrome developement tool
- While doing the Performance Test, I always use Safari on iPhone. I prefer to use the Inspector feature from the real machine to find the wrong issue.
  * Step 1 : iOS Settings > Safari > Advanced
  * Step 2 : Turn on Web Inspector and follow the instruction to enable the Develop menu feature of Safari on MacOS\

  * Step 3 : Visit the test URL from the Safari on your iOS
  * Step 4 : Open the Safari > Develop > iPhone, then you will find the right page list under this section.
